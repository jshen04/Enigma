# Enigma
Stuyvesant High School Spring 2022 Cybersecurity Final Project

This is our final project in Cybersecurity where we made an enigma machine encoder and decoder

How to use it:
1. Git clone our repository
2. Cd into app
3. python3 enigma_m3.py
4. Input in your values
* Now this might get confusing but essentially how you would use it would be 
```python3 app/enigma_m3.py RotorNumber1 RingSetting1 Position1 RotorNumber2 RingSetting2 Position2 RotorNumber3 RingSetting3 Position3 Reflector PLugs Pairs``` with plugs and pairs being optional

An example of this would be ```python enigma_m3.py 1 A A 2 A A 3 A A C```

Then you enter in the string you want encoded/decoded and the answer pops out
