Justin + Jeremy 5/24 17:22 20:34
Added in Input and updated README
Got in a call and tried our best to fix rotors for an hour and nothing happened!
HELP HELP HEEEELLLLLLPPPPPPPPPPP

Justin 5/25 15:35 
Traced through the different outputs, found a potential solution in class by forwarding our own rotors x amount of times

Jeremy 5/25 23:53
Finished enima m3 ring settings and positions - we are done!

Justin 5/25 15:29
Fixed some errors that I found when testing on lab computer

Jeremy :heart: Justin 5/26 
:heart_eyes::heart_eyes::heart_eyes: Created good interface for setting up and passing messages in enigma
