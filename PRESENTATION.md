## What we did
- Essentially we made an encoder and decoder with the enigma machine.
- Our machine will allow you to encode and decode where you are able to set rotors, ring settings, plugboard, and reflectors

# What is the Enigma Machine
- The first enigma machine was made in the 20th century by German engineer Arthur Scherbius in 1918, who sought to sell it for commercial, rather than military, purposes
- Since then, many versions of the enigma machine have been made through the years, the most infamous of which is the German M3
